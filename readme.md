Question 1:
convert a string into array then use.mapwith if statements then join it

Question 2:

turn the string into an array and do for each. check if the letter is in the object
if it is i would add one to the number
if its not i would add it and set value to 1
then do object.entries

that will give you second array then array.flat() then join()
